PyTorch
Stable Diffusion pipeline from Hugging Face
Image processing and visualization libraries

Sets Device

Loads a Pretrained Model
Loads the Stable Diffusion Turbo model (stabilityai/sd-turbo)
Disables the safety checker
Moves model to selected device

Defines Prompts
Medical text prompts related to:
Healthy chest X-rays
Pneumonia
Ground-glass opacities
These prompts are used to generate synthetic medical images.

Generates Synthetic Images
Creates 512×512 images
Saves them in a folder named:
